*When we make learning simple, we make opportunity possible for everyone.*

Welcome to the official repository and open source code for the **Simple E<sup>x</sup>planations** website—an educational platform powered by my YouTube channel [Simple Explanations](https://youtube.com/@dheirya). I created this site to help students explore STEM topics through accessible videos, smart quizzes, and curated resources. Check out the site [here](https://simplexp.org)!
